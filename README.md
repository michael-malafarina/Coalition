# Coalition
A turn-based strategy roguelike

Coalition is a personal project I worked on during the summer of 2022.  It's an incomplete game, but has a rough functional demo of the combat and progression system. This should be considered in a "pre-alpha" state.

HOW TO PLAY
- At the start select three of five procedurally generated units
- Each unit combines a class with an ability set
- During the game, units can be controlled with the mouse and keyboard.  
   - To use an ability, hit the corresponding number (top left).
- The red bar above a unit is HEALTH and the blue bar is GUARD.
- You can go to the unit menu to explore and upgrade abilities by pressing the ESC key
- Each time you win a battle, new enemies will appear and you will earn experience to improve abilities
- Press ALT-F4 to quit
