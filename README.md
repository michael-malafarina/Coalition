# Coalition
A turn-based strategy roguelike

Coalition is a personal project I worked on during the summer of 2022.  It's far from a complete game, but has a rough functional demo of the combat and progression system. This should be considered in a "pre-alpha" state.  This was a fun learning experience:  I built a lot of modular and in depth systems to manage abilities, conditions, and unit types fairly elegantly.  It has some known bugs and limitations relating to the AI unit pathfinding and the procedurally built levels.  

HOW TO PLAY
- At the start select three of five procedurally generated units
- Each unit combines a class with an ability set
- During the game, units can be controlled with the mouse and keyboard.  
   - To use an ability, hit the corresponding number (top left).
- The red bar above a unit is HEALTH and the blue bar is GUARD.
- You can go to the unit menu to explore and upgrade abilities by pressing the ESC key
- Each time you win a battle, new enemies will appear and you will earn experience to improve abilities
- Press ALT-F4 to quit
